Hello! This is going to be my very first blog on my website. Today, I'm going to share with you my experience with Astro and its community.

If you are curious about what is Astro, it is a [static site generator](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/) where you can use different JavaScript Frameworks for the UI and ship them as static HTML on the build. It uses "Island Architecture" where Astro extracts your UI into smaller, isolated components on the page. Unused JavaScript is replaced with lightweight static HTML, guaranteeing faster loads on your project.

I started using [Astro](https://astro.build) last month because of its cool templates, to begin with, and it’s easy to use for beginners. For my first project, I picked the default template which is going to be my new personal website. At first, I was confused about where to start, so I just checked the docs so I can learn with them. It was also my first time using components so I can reuse them on other pages too.

This is what my website was when I just started Astro looks like, you can find how my site looks like back then on [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220000000000*/lanceross.xyz). I don't always update it on Wayback Machine because it takes a lot of time to do it manually and they don't crawl my website 😅.

I was getting used to it while focusing on making my website look beautiful. I started to learn how does Astro work and how do you create your website with it? I tried deleting all the default components and started to make my own (without ready-made components that I just found on the internet). I am getting a lot of positive feedback about my site that it looks beautiful. After a few weeks of learning it, I finally built this beautiful website of mine using Astro and Tailwind CSS 😍.

That's it for now! I hope you enjoyed reading this blog post! If you have any questions, feel free to ask me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lancerossdev) or [GitHub](https://github.com/lancerossdev)! I'll be happy to answer your questions!
