While planning for a new feature on my website, I decided to add an analytics tracker for my site using Umami Analytics. I've been using its beta version for a while now and I really like it. I wanted to try self-hosting it and I'm going to show you too how to do it with Supabase and Vercel.

## What is Umami Analytics?

Umami Analytics is a simple, fast, and open source web analytics tool alternative to Google Analytics. You can self host it or use their [cloud version](https://umami.is/pricing) which is currently on beta.

## Why did I choose Umami Analytics?

I want to try an analytics tracker for my website. Google Analytics is an easy to go since most of us have Google Account right? I've tried it back then and it was pain to get it working and it's also slowing down my website, so I stopped using any kind of website analytics for a while. 

## How do you self host Umami Analytics?
For this tutorial, I'm going to use Supabase and Vercel. You can use any other MySQL or Postgres Database and App Hosting that you want. I'm using Supabase and Vercel because it's the easiest way for me.

Make sure you have a Supabase and Vercel Account. If you don't have one, you can create one for free.

### Step 1: Create a Supabase Project
Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.io) and create a new project. You can choose any plan that you want and a close region where you're going to host your project. Make sure to set a **strong password** for your database!

Get the database connection string from the Settings > Database page, then scroll to the bottom for the Connection Pooling section and copy the Connection string. It should look something like this: 
```bash
postgres://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@host:6543/postgres
```

### Step 2: Test it locally
Fork the [Umami Analytics](https://github.com/umami-software/umami) repository and clone it to your local machine. After that, open the project on your favorite code editor and install the dependencies by running `yarn install` since the project uses `yarn` as its package manager.

Now, for testing locally, you need to create a `.env` file and add the following environment variables given by Supabase:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@host:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true
HASH_SALT=anything-random-here
```

You can add any valid string for the hash salt. You should now be able to build and start Umami on a local server with `yarn run build` followed by `yarn start`.

> IMPORTANT: After you accessed your account with the default login credentials, please change the username and password immediately to avoid getting your Umami Analytics dashboard get exploited by hackers.

### Step 3: Deploy Umami to Vercel

Now, you can deploy Umami to Vercel.

First, create a new project on Vercel and connect it to your GitHub account. Then, select the `umami` repository to proceed. Before deploying the app, go to the project settings first and add the environment variables.

Now your Umami Analytics is now deployed to Vercel! 🎉

### Step 4: Add Umami to your website

Now, you can add Umami to your website. First, create a website on the Umami Dashboard with the domain of your site. You can add it on the `<head>` element tag to your website by looking for the script tracking that looks something like this:

```html
<script async defer data-website-id="YOUR-WEBSITE-ID" src="https://example.com/umami.js"></script>
```

And there you go, you now have your own Umami Analytics! This website also uses one back then, but I decided to remove it since I don't want to track my own website and my visitors anymore 😅

That's it for now! I hope you enjoyed reading this tutorial! If you have any questions, feel free to ask me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lancerossdev) or [GitHub](https://github.com/lancerossdev)! I'll be happy to answer your questions!
