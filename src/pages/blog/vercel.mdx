I’ve been using many static site hosts for my projects and especially for my personal website. After making final decision, I chose Vercel and here's why.

## Why Vercel?

I chose Vercel because of its better quality service than other providers out there. It offers a blazing-fast network and many more products that I like which are Next.js, `@vercel/og` and many more.


## How did I migrate from Netlify to Vercel?

I use a lot of services from Netlify including their nameservers, edge functions, and more. It is pain migrating all those to Vercel and it will take time to do it.

### Nameservers

Propagating nameservers from Netlify to Vercel is really easy. I can’t find any documentation on how to do it but at least I managed to do it on my own.

Basically, you just need to edit your nameservers on your domain registrar to these and wait for around 2 hours for it to propagate.

`ns1.vercel-dns.com`

`ns2.vercel-dns.com`

## Projects

Since my projects are just made with Astro, it is easy to migrate them. I just create a new project and point it to a repository and Vercel will do that job for me!

## But, there’s an issue…

For my Open Graph Images, I use Netlify Edge Functions to generate them. I don’t know what to do until I found `@vercel/og` and it was awesome! The Netlify version from [Matt Kane](https://twitter.com/ascorbic) is great since Netlify just bundles the edge function to your static site like magic. But, Vercel is different. You need to install the [`@vercel/og`](https://github.com/vercel/satori) package and you need to use Next.js and React to use it. I don’t know how to use Next.js and React so I learned a bit about it and I managed to make it work. You can check out my [Open Graph Image Generator](https://github.com/lancerossdev/satori) to see how it works.


## Conclusion

Should you try Vercel? It's ultimately up to you to decide whether Vercel is the right choice for your needs. It's always a good idea to do some research and compare different hosting options before making a decision.
